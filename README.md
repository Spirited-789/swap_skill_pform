Skill Swap Platform
üåü Overview
The Skill Swap Platform is a mini-application designed to foster a community where users can exchange knowledge and expertise. It provides a seamless way for individuals to list the skills they can offer, request specific skills from others, and manage these swap arrangements. This platform aims to facilitate learning, collaboration, and personal growth by connecting people with complementary skills.

‚ú® Features
The platform is built with a comprehensive set of features to ensure a rich and intuitive user experience for both regular users and administrators.

User Profiles & Discovery
Basic Information: Users can create a profile including their Name, Location (optional), and a Profile Photo (optional).

Skill Listing: Clearly display a list of skills the user is offering.

Skill Requests: Maintain a list of skills the user is looking to acquire or wants others to provide.

Availability: Users can specify their availability (e.g., "weekends," "evenings") to facilitate scheduling swaps.

Profile Visibility: Users have control over their privacy, with the option to make their profile public or private.

Browse & Search: Users can efficiently browse or search for other users based on specific skills (e.g., "Photoshop," "Excel").

Swap Management
Request & Accept/Reject Swaps: Users can initiate swap requests with others. The recipient of a request can then choose to accept or reject the offer.

Swap Status Tracking: The platform provides clear visibility into the status of swap requests, categorizing them as "current" (accepted/ongoing) or "pending."

Cancel Swap Requests: Users have the ability to delete a swap request if it has not yet been accepted by the recipient.

Ratings & Feedback: After a swap is completed, users can provide ratings or feedback to acknowledge the experience and help build trust within the community.

Admin Role & Moderation
The platform includes a robust set of administrative tools to ensure a safe and well-maintained environment.

Content Moderation: Administrators can review and reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions to maintain content quality.

User Management: Admins have the power to ban users who violate platform policies, ensuring a positive community experience.

Swap Monitoring: Comprehensive monitoring tools allow admins to track the status of all swaps, including pending, accepted, and cancelled requests.

Platform-Wide Messaging: Admins can send broadcast messages to all users for important announcements such as feature updates or downtime alerts.

Reporting & Analytics: Admins can download various reports, including user activity logs, feedback logs, and overall swap statistics, for insights and platform management.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: React (for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (for utility-first CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design)

Backend & Database (Choose one based on project needs and team preference):

Firebase: A comprehensive platform by Google offering NoSQL databases (Firestore, Realtime Database), authentication, hosting, and serverless functions (Cloud Functions) for real-time capabilities and backend logic.

Supabase: An open-source alternative to Firebase, providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and serverless functions (Edge Functions).

Email Sending: A transactional email service (e.g., MailerSend, Brevo, SendGrid, EmailJS) will be integrated for sending automated emails (e.g., swap request notifications).

Web Push Notifications: A service like OneSignal or PushEngage will be used for displaying notifications under a bell icon and as desktop/mobile push alerts.
